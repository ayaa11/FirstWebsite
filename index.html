			<p class="dropcap">Checking the errors of the webpages by using <b>W3C validator</b>. Before the submission type the <B>URL</B> of the website on the <b>W:\drive</b> including the <b>zip file</b>. Also, it has to include <b>PDF</b> files or screenshots of the validations. In addition, if there are any problems can not be corrected, it should be written in the end of the learning journal. The most important thing is to re-validate after each time of fixing the errors. After that, the step of cleaning up the <b>CSS</b> it helps to see the rules clearer and easy to understand it. One of the errors that i have got in the end is when I tried to move the list of learning journal to the centre, all the text that contain <b>&#60;ul&#62;</b> element moved to the middle. Therefore, it was not look arranged then I tried to change the rules of <b>.menu</b> and that worked perfectly. Also, after finishing all the content I realised that the learning journal should be read from the bottom to the top. That is why I need to move the weekly text to make it as a good learning journal. In my opinion, I find making the web pages is enjoyable and interesting. However, it needs to be critical in use and takes a long time in order to make a good website. I had learned and experienced new things that gave me useful information which I might use it through my life.</p>

			<p class="dropcap">In general, this week shows the forms of uses of these elements <b>&#60;form&#62;</b>,<b>&#60;fieldset&#62;</b>,<b>&#60;legend&#62;</b>,<b>&#60;lable&#62;</b>,<b>&#60;input&#62;</b>,<b>&#60;textrea&#62;</b> and <b>&#60;button&#62;</b>. Start with form it is help to give id attribute in contact page which is <b>contact.html</b>. After that, we use label in order to type the name, email and url. Also, <b>&#60;fiedset&#62;</b> element could be used to make the contact page look more organised because it has the title. Then, adding a box of comments that allow the user to send his message through the learning journal. I have added a cursor for the links styles in <b>CSS</b>, so that allows the user to control on the mouse type it can be in a different type by providing an image into the url. In the end, adding some questions might help the user and the button that send all this information. </p>

			<h3>Week 8: HTML Layout </h3>
			<p class="outset">Published on <time datetime="2016-11-28">November 28, 2016</time></p>
			</header>
          
            <img src="images/define.png" alt="Layout elements" class="align-center medium" />
            <p class="dropcap">  Layout the image and some of the text inside <b>&#60;article&#62;</b> element. Then, trying to lay out a gallery of some flexible images. First, typing class inside <b>&#60;div&#62;</b> then another two class inside <b>&#60;ol&#62;</b> and <b>&#60;li&#62;</b>. Repeating the step more than once to show the images in columns. In the end, need to add the <b>CSS</b> rules and call it media but before that each one has to have dot. Such as, <b>.media</b>, <b>.media-item</b> and <b>.media-content</b>. For the content we add some rules like background- color, display, flex- direction padding and width. If you have difficulties in laying the images out in three columns which I have this problem. Therefore, in order to solve that need to add some rules <b>.media</b> and <b>.media li</b> in <b>CSS</b> style. In this week text I have put a screenshot image of <b>HTML</b> Layout Elements from <cite><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_layout.asp">W3school</a></cite> website.</p>

			<h3>Week 7: Editing media </h3>
			<p class="outset">Published on <time datetime="2016-11-21">November 21, 2016</time></p>
			</header>
			<p class="dropcap">This text is about making the images and videos flexible and in a good look. For the full size image, we should use <b>&#60;style&#62;</b> element and add <b>CSS</b> rules inside. Adding width and height of the image after <b>&#60;header&#62;</b> element in order to embed the image. After all that, we need to save and test it to make everything work. There is a way of making the image more flexible which is removing the height and width from the <b>HTML</b> document and add some rules about float, padding width and max-width to <b>CSS</b>. Videos need to have more complicated rules, in this learning journal I might not have a video. First of all, should have one on YouTube or other. Then, using an element called <b>&#60;iframe&#62;</b> and adding similar rules of an image in both <b>HTML & CSS</b>. In this week there are more to learn in CSS one of the basics is adding a background image inside <b>&#60;body&#62;</b> element. It was not easy in the begining because it has to be written in <b>CSS</b> rules and specify the file name. For example, i wrote url("images/bg.png") but it was not working then I added two dots and dash before the images that works in a good way. Editing the images in order to look nicer I added a rule called the border reduis and a rule called box shadow. </p>

			<h3>Week 6: Response the Learning Journal </h3>
			<p class="outset">Published on <time datetime="2016-11-14">November 14, 2016</time></p>
			</header>
			<p class="dropcap">Start with styling the web pages using <b>&#60;main&#62;</b>, <b>&#60;article&#62;</b> and <b>&#60;aside&#62;</b> elements. Then adding some codes inside <b>&#60;head&#62;</b>. But before that it is a brilliant idea to sketch the web pages which will make it more flexible to the user. The learning Journal need to have <b>&#60;meta&#62;</b> element in order to define the character of metadata that will allow everyone to use it in mobile as the desktop browsers. There are some rules need to be added in CSS style sheet in order to style small screen lay out for mobiles, the max-width will be 70em. Changing the width and height of images data from <b>HTML</b> to 100% width in <b>CSS</b> to make it more flexible. After that, the table need to be response to fit small screens, I had changed the width from 100% to 60 then it moved to the left which what I tried to do many times but did not work before. Therefore, now it fixed and become more suitable. </p>

			<h3>Week 5: Styling using CSS </h3>
			<p class="outset">Published on <time datetime="2016-10-31">October 31, 2016</time></p>
			</header>
			<p class="dropcap">Style <b>CSS</b> using <b>boilerplate.css</b> and editing texts more specifically for example, the font-size of percentage into <b>&#60;body&#62;</b> element. I had changed the name of <b>boilerplate.css</b> to <b>style.css</b>. Editing the font-family, colour, font-size and line-height that all inside <b>&#60;h&#62;</b> in CSS which is for styling paragraphs. There is a type of paragraph styling called <b>Drop caps</b> that organise the text in a good look, it is usually used in magazines and newspapers. I tried to use in each week paragraph that made it look better. After that, make the image floated and while the text around that would be by adding new class inside <b>&#60;body&#62;</b> and call it <b>fltlt</b> and <b>clear</b>. Then, add the rules of both of them like the float could be in the left.</p>

			<p class="dropcap"> After adding content to the <b>html pages</b>, it has to be validated before starting <b>CSS</b>. The style sheet should be saved on the Web folder <b>boilerplate.css</b> then, attaching it into the web pages. After that, downloading <b>normalize.css</b> to have more improvement of styling. This learning journal dose not has normalize, because it is an optional to the user. This is some rules to add in the style page, background-color, font-family and font-size. It is easy to edit it and have some nice colours. I had realised that in <b>CSS</b> we use the word colour in American English and there are words that I used in Amirican English. In addition, style other elements like <b>&#60;h1&#62;</b>, <b>.menu</b>, <b>&#60;header&#62;</b>, <b>.post</b> and others. I have added border style which is for the text inside the element <b>&#60;p&#62;</b>. In the end of this week, it should be validated with <b>CSS</b> stylesheet.</p>

			<p class="dropcap"> In this week we learn how to add more lists for <b>index.html</b>. Also, how to make table using <b>&#60;table&#62;</b> element. Inside that element we several elements that make the table, <b>&#60;tr&#62;</b> to indicate the start of each row. The follow element is <b>&#60;th&#62;</b> it can be more than one depends on the dates of the week. Then, <b>&#60;td&#62;</b> which is for each cell in the row. In addition to that, if you want to add the date without having an information in the cell you can have the element as empty and continue with the follow one. Such us, <b>&#60;td&#62;</b> and <b>&#60;/td&#62;</b>. I wanted to have the timetable in the centre of the border, so I tried to change the width of the table container to 100 percent. Then, improving the Journal by adding some writing from what we have read from books or websites and adding references. Also, we are able to quote a text which is going to be added more useful information. At the end, in every week we need to save everything we add on the Web drive and validate it. </p>

Add lists in order to make the content clearer to the reader and easier to use the pages. Using the elements <b>&#60;ol&#62;</b> and <b>&#60;li&#62;</b> to number the list. However, using elements <b>&#60;ul&#62;</b> and <b>&#60;li&#62;</b> is also for making list but for bullet point. Adding an images that related to the content, which will make the journal more interesting and attractive. Then add an email link inside the <b>&#60;footer&#62;</b>. Navigate pages using anchors, before <b>&#60;footer&#62;</b> and it can be more than once in the webpage which will make the user go to the top the page faster. Therefore, this is one of the flexibility of using the learning journal. In this week, the students learn how to add an image inside the element <b>&#60;figure&#62;</b> and to cite where this image came from use <b>&#60;small&#62;</b> element. Before the last this step for typing an email link and it have to be inside <b>&#60;footer&#62;</b> element. In the end, it should be validated. The book that recommended for learning HTML and CSS is called <b>HTML & CSS</b> written by Jon Duckett which is very useful and easy to read. At the end, the webpages need to be validated.</p>
